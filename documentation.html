				<h2 class="pb-3">Our project</h2>
        <p><b>Hidden Italy</b> is a virtual project realized by Ariele Santello, Benedetta Togni and Cristian Santini. This website aims to be an <b>ongoing exhibition about marginal identities</b> in Italy, especially about African immigrants, their lives and struggles, confronted with the issues of a nation in which <b>social inclusion</b> still lacks to involve refugees and asylum seekers. With this digital environment we want to create an <b>open space of representation, communication and collaboration</b>, while aiming at <b>enhancing the public awareness</b> related to the Italian reception and integration system.</p>
        <h2 class="pb-3">Concepts and purposes</h2>
				<p>From north to south Italy immigrant occupy abandoned places, can they be buildings, farmhouses, shacks or open air places. Most of the time they are without electricity or water, under bad health conditions. For informal settlement we mean, according to <b>Medici senza frontiere</b>, a population composed of refugees excluded from governative welcoming systems, that has to be of non-seasonal type and self- organized.  Everybody knows the refugee camp, where they are placed. They have a precise location, they are from a legislative point of view “places”. An informal settlement is a non-place because it legally doesn’t exist and the people that live there are “invisible”. Of course they occupy a geographical place, and also most of them work, but they still remain invisible because they juridically are not present. One of the purposes of this project is to try to give them a geographical existence, maps playing an important role in our virtual exhibition. <b>Hidden Italy</b> is an existing country composed by people that live and work, maybe also in our same city.</p>
        <p>
          Since we are open to public involvements and contribution, we expect this project to grow and to host different types of content. At the moment, the project is divided in <b>3 sections</b>:
          <ul>
            <li>Data visualization</li>
            <li>Interactive Map</li>
            <li>Newspaper Analysis</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since our goal is to enhance the public debate related to the living conditions of minorities in Italy, we thought that we had to study at first some <b>data</b> that are related to the immigration sprout of the decade 2010-2020 and to how European and Italian policies were unable to manage a critical situation without generating complex long-lasting issues. For this reason we decided to offer a service of <b>data visualization</b>, based on the 2016-2018 reports of <b>Medici Senza Frontiere</b> called <i>Fuori Campo</i>, to show the real numbers related to the living conditions of thousands and thousands of people that every day on Italian soil sleep in tents or slums and work for less than 2 euros per hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we believe that new <b>medias</b> can improve the knowledge we have about social phenomenon all around us, we decided to <b>promote artistic projects</b> that can help to trace vivid portraits of situations too often hidden and neglected. By displaying the pictures of refugees and asylum seekers by the Italian photographer <b>Giulio Piscitelli</b> in a <b>georeferenced map</b> we don’t want to trace an aesthetic of marginality; on the contrary we want to make things change by <b>exposing</b> the unacceptable ways in which things go outside the comfort zone of the vast majority of Italians. We strongly believe that art can still enhance <b>empathy and awareness</b>, and we still hope that interactive environments can involve people and attract their interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition we wanted to study how the Italian public debate has dealt with the problem of migrants and refugees left out from the public integration system and we collected a small corpus of <b>newspaper articles</b> to which we applied general distant reading techniques to display in a intuitive way how the public debate <b>shaped the figure</b> of those invisible lives from 2017 to 2020. To do so we used <i>wordcloud</i> and <i>linked concordances</i>.
        </p>
        <h2 class="pb-3">Target user</h2>
        <p>
          Vistors of our museum can be of course young people but the real challenge for us is to engage people that don’t belong to the millenial generation and that they can have difficulties in using technology and also difficulties in finding valid information in the internet and are much more exposed to the fake news phenomena. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="pb-3">Development and Technological Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          As stated before, in order to develop this virtual environment we decided to exploit the main technologies that the <b>web 2.0</b> offered us. This website is designed by our team by using <b>HTML, CSS and Javascript</b>, with the employment of very popular frameworks and libraries such as <b>Bootstrap</b> and <b>JQuery</b>. The website is designed to be supported by the majority of browsers and to be suited for any type of device.
        </p> 
        <p>
          Data visualization was realized by exploiting the services offered by <a href="https://flourish.studio/"target="_blank">Flourish
        </a>. Georeferenced photographic gallery is made by using the open-source web-based software <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/"target="_blank">ArcGIS StoryMap</a>. The newspaper corpus was realized by scraping the web; in addition general algorithms were used to tokenize the corpus and remove stopwords and noisy words. The wordcloud was realized by using the web-based software <a href="https://wordart.com/"target="_blank">WordArt</a> while the linking concordances are made with another browser software, <a href="https://voyant-tools.org/"target="_blank">Voyant tools</a>.
        </p>
        <h2 class="pb-3">Roles</h2>
        <p>
          <b>The project was supervised and led in harmony by all three team members</b>, although each curated one of the three projects inside our website:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Benedetta Togni</b> curated <a href="data-visualization.html" target="_blank">Data visualization</a></li>
            <li><b>Ariele Santello</b> curated <a href="interactive-map.html" target="_blank">Interactive Map</a></li>
            <li><b>Cristian Santini</b> curated the overall design of the website and <a href="news-analysis.html" target="_blank">Newspaper Analysis</a></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2 class="pb-3">Museological Approach</h2>
        <p>
          This ongoing exhibition is devoted to the issue of refugees and asylum seekers in Italy. It was conceived as a <b>digital open space</b> in which we can represent complex situations, which too often are hidden or ignored, by using the power that new virtual environments have in deepening our experience and enhancing our <b>interpretation</b> of the world. Following the taxonomy proposed by <b>Simona Caraceni</b> in <i>Designing a taxonomy for virtual museums for the use of Avicom professionals (2015)</i> we can describe our <b>museological approach</b> with the following categories:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Needs:</b> Interpretation of a complex situation in real word by means of new medias</li>
            <li><b>Space:</b> Interactive browsing of digital content</li>
            <li><b>Technologies:</b> Web technologies, dynamic data visualization, GIS application, distant reading techniques</li>
            <li><b>Content:</b> Dynamic data, digital images and text</li>
            <li><b>Virtual/Real:</b> Virtual space with Virtual content</li>
            <li><b>Visitors Contribution:</b> Allowed, in order to enrich data, provide feedbacks and contributions</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
         <h2 class="pb-3">Interaction</h2>
         <p>
